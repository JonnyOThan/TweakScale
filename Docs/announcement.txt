// ROUGH DRAFT!

WARNING: DO NOT use this on your existing saves or craft files without backing them up first.  While I'm pretty sure I can eventually address all the game-breaking issues I'm also pretty sure I haven't yet, and saving your stuff with this version and then trying to go back to other versions will most likely not work

# What is this?

TweakScale is a mod that allows you to rescale parts in the vessel editor.  All of their stats and properties are affected realistically - tanks contain more fuel, engines get stronger, solar panels produce more power, etc.  It's one of KSP's oldest mods and has been maintained by many different people over the years.

I've forked pellinor's version of TweakScale and updated it for modern KSP to provide a simpler and streamlined version.  My plan is to eventually offer this as an alternative to the current version of TweakScale.  I've paid special attention to the following areas:

## User experience

* New buttons in part action window to adjust scaling behaviors
 * Toggle for scaling changes to affect the entire subtree
 * Button to apply the current part's scale to the subtree (NYI)
* Scaling gizmo akin to offset and move (NYI)
* All parts are supported with reasonable defaults unless they opt-out or match certain filters to trap known issues (AllTweak will still override this and enable *everything*)
* Reduced dependencies to only ModuleManager and Harmony
* Optimized for better performance
 * better loading time to main menu
 * better switch-to-editor time
 * scaling a part is more responsive
 * less performance impact in flight scene
 * probably better save/load performance, but I'd have to check
	// TODO: maybe get some data to compare?

## Robustness

* fixed part attachments when variants or B9PartSwitch are involved
* scaling engine effects works correctly (NYI)
* scaling docking ports works as expected (NYI)
* Craft files and saved games no longer break from changes in TweakScale configs
* More resilient to problems caused by missing dependencies, problems with other mods, and incorrect installations
// TODO: more here
* Made it easier to add or customize TweakScale support for other mods

# Why not work to improve the current TweakScale?

The gist of it is: it would take far more energy than I have.  If I believed this option was possible, I would do it (because usually, this *is* the best option).

However, TweakScaleRescaled (this fork) is licensed CC-BY-NC-SA.  Its code may be used by anyone else provided they abide by the license terms.  Pull requests are also welcome from anyone who wants to contribute.

# Compatibilty

Backwards compatibility is a core goal of TweakScaleRescaled.  Existing craft files, saved games, configs, and mods that depend on Scale_Redist should work seamlessly if you change to TweakScaleRescaled (once all the bugs are worked out and it hits final release).

However, ongoing interoperability with other versions of TweakScale is not a goal.  I will make a reasonable effort to support it where it's easy.  In order to make the improvements necessary, data structures and assumptions have to be altered in ways that are difficult to reverse.

TweakScaleRescaled should *just work* with almost all stock or modded parts.  It includes the stock and mod-support patches that were written by the previous authors (updated as necessary).  There's also a new patching system based on heuristics that will apply to all other parts unless they opt out or are blocked by filters for things that are known to break.

Only KSP 1.12 is supported.  Other versions 1.8-1.11 *may* work but have not been tested and are not a priority.

# Dependencies

* ModuleManager
* Harmony
* KSP Community Fixes is recommended to address stock bugs that become more apparent when using TweakScale
