// TweakScaleRescaled will add scaling support to every part that isn't marked tweakscale_ignore, making AllTweak mostly obsolete.
// AllTweak might still be useful to people because it doesn't care about tweakscale_ignore
// But it also uses type = stack without setting the default (so it defaults to 1.25m)
// Our logic below does a better job of finding defaults for parts
// At the risk of being a bad neighbor, let's provide a better version of the alltweak patch if it's installed
// The nice thing about this though is that it runs early enough (not in FINAL or LAST) that other mods can customize the behavior after the fact (e.g. re-adding the tweakscale_ignore marker)
