// So this one is fun...
// these patches are marked :AFTER[RealPlume]:FINAL which is a bug.  you can't have more than one pass specifier.  The first one will be used and :FINAL is ignored.
// all of these patches are intended to remove the tweakscale module.
// The first patch *renames* an existing part (KK_SPX_Merlin1Ci -> PMB_Falcon1Merlin1A) and there's also KK_SPX_Kestrel -> PMB_Falcon1Kestrel
// then the rest of the patches clone those parts with different names and stats
// So to handle this correctly, I think we need to mark these parts as tweakscale_ignore but it has to be some point after AFTER[RealPlume]

// FOR[TweakScale] should be after AFTER[RealPlume] (alphabetically later)
@PART[PMB_Falcon1Merlin*|PMB_Falcon1Kestrel*]:FOR[TweakScale]
