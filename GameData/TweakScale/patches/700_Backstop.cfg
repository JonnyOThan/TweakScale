// add a free-scale module to anything that doesn't have one
// I keep going back and forth about whether this should check for a tweakscale_node_size field and use stack scaling in that case
// I think there's probably a lot of parts that have a node_stack_top or node_stack_bottom but shouldn't be stack scaled, like structural parts.
// it will probably be easier to apply defaults and one-off patches to the things that SHOULD be stack scaled like fuel tanks, and just leave the backstop as free scale.
// It's far worse for something to be marked as stack scale when it shouldn't than for something that should be stack scaled to be marked as free.
